## Project

This project aims to provide a modern HTTP mock server for your daily project using [Dhall lang](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang) configuration to describe mocks.

### Goal

Mocking http server can be painful. The installation and the configuration of the servers and their responses could be handy and force to use templates generations or external providers.

Dhall-mock project aim to be quickly installable by providing a standalone binary and extensive by using an external functional language to describe the custom responses you need.

### Why dhall

We choose to base our configuration on [Dhall lang](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang) for multiple reasons but here are the most important ones :

 - Complete **functional language** - it could be as easy as defining static response as create a set of functions that will generate complex responses and customisation based on inputs.
 - **Typed language** - you can compile and verify your configuration without running dhall-mock server. As soon as your configuration match the types we are providing it can be integrated.
 - **No side effects** - you use a real programming language with libraries, living ecosystem and could imagine complex configuration pipelines and in the same time coul use any configuration even provided by third party since the langage donesn't provide any way to do side effect on the machine.
 - **We wanted to** - Most importantly, we wanted to use dhall because we like this language and wanted to use it :smile: 

## Usage

### Command line

```bash
> dhall-mock 0.0.1

USAGE:
    main [OPTIONS] <configuration-files>...

#### Use a static configuration

Create a static configuration file `static.dhall` :
```dhall
let Mock = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhall-mock/dhall-mock/master/dhall/Mock/package.dhall

let expectations = [
                       { request  = Mock.HttpRequest::{ method  = Some Mock.HttpMethod.GET
                                                      , path    = Some "/greet/pwet"
                                                      }
                       , response = Mock.HttpResponse::{ statusCode   = Mock.statusCreated
                                                       , body         = Some "Hello, pwet ! Comment que ca biche ?"
                                                       }
                      }
                      ,{ request  = Mock.HttpRequest::{ method  = Some Mock.HttpMethod.GET
                                                      , path    = Some "/greet/wololo"
                                                      }
                      , response = Mock.HttpResponse::{ statusCode   = Mock.statusOK
                                                      , body         = Some "Hello, Wololo !"
                                                      }
                      }
                   ]

in expectations
```

If you have [dhall](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/howtos/How-to-integrate-Dhall.html#external-executable) installed on your machine you can test the file by running `dhall resolve --file static.dhall`
```bash
> dhall  resolve --file static.dhall
let Mock =
      { Body = < JSON : { json : Text } | TEXT : { text : Text } >
      ...

let expectations =
      [ { request = Mock.HttpRequest::{
          , method = Some Mock.HttpMethod.GET
          , path = Some "/greet/pwet"
          }
        , response = Mock.HttpResponse::{
          , statusCode = Mock.statusCreated
          , body = Some "Hello, pwet ! Comment que ca biche ?"
          }
        }
      , { request = Mock.HttpRequest::{
          , method = Some Mock.HttpMethod.GET
          , path = Some "/greet/wololo"
          }
        , response = Mock.HttpResponse::{
          , statusCode = Mock.statusOK
          , body = Some "Hello, Wololo !"
          }
        }
      ]

in  expectations
```

Start the server using this configuration :
```bash
> dhall-mock static.dhall
[2020-05-06T19:52:10Z INFO  main] Start dhall mock project ðŸ‘‹
[2020-05-06T19:52:10Z INFO  dhall_mock::mock::service] Start load static.dhall config
[2020-05-06T19:52:10Z INFO  dhall_mock::web::mock] Http server started on http://0.0.0.0:8088
[2020-05-06T19:52:10Z INFO  dhall_mock::web::admin] Admin server started on http://0.0.0.0:8089
[2020-05-06T19:52:10Z INFO  dhall_mock::mock::service] Loaded static.dhall, in 0 secs
[2020-05-06T19:52:10Z INFO  main] Configuration static.dhall loaded
```

Try it out ! 
```bash
> curl http://localhost:8088/greet/pwet
Hello, pwet ! Comment que ca biche ?
> curl http://localhost:8088/greet/wololo
Hello, Wololo !
```

### Admin server

Admin server allow you to know which configurations are available on the server and create new configurations.

#### `GET /expectations` 

Will return all the current mock configured in the servers.

Example :
```bash
> curl http://localhost:8089/expectations | jq
[
  {
    "request": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/greet/pwet",
      "body": null,
      "params": [],
      "headers": {}
    },
    "response": {
      "statusCode": 201,
      "statusReason": null,
      "body": "Hello, pwet ! Comment que ca biche ?",
      "headers": {}
    }
  },
  {
    "request": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/greet/wololo",
      "body": null,
      "params": [],
      "headers": {}
    },
    "response": {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "statusReason": null,
      "body": "Hello, Wololo !",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }
]
```

#### `POST /expectations`  

Create a new configuration with the dhall configuration in the request body.

Result :
 - `201` : The configuration was successfully parsed and is usable
 - `400` : The configuration in the body is invalid, compilation error in the response body

Example :
```bash
curl -X POST -i --data-binary "static.dhall" http://localhost:8089/expectations
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
content-length: 0
date: Wed, 06 May 2020 20:10:58 GMT
```

## Configuration

### Query

Http request received by the http servers are matched against configuration.  
Currently, the first configuration (by inserting order) to match all of a configuration criteria is used.  

You can add filter on: 
 - Path
 - Http method (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `OPTION`)
 - Http header
 - Query param
 - Body (Json or Text), body filter is matching the totality of the body, no partial matching for the moment

All filters are optional and if a none is provided it's that the configuration accept any request for this filter

### Response

Http response coul be configured with the following :
 - Status code (default `200`)
 - Http header
 - Body
 - Status reason

### Dhall typesTBD

### Configuration sample

A static configuration that create two responses based on `GET` method for `/greet/pwet` and `greet/wololo` : [configuration](dhall/static.dhall)

Configuration that create responses based on a list of users and for each create a `GET ["ContentType": "application/json"] /users/{id}` route with Json body for each one : [configuration](dhall/example.dhall)
